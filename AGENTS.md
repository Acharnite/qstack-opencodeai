# gstack — AI Engineering Workflow

gstack is a collection of SKILL.md files that give AI agents structured roles for
software development. Each skill is a specialist: CEO reviewer, eng manager,
designer, QA lead, release engineer, debugger, and more.

## Available skills

Skills live in `.agents/skills/` (or `~/.config/opencode/skills/gstack/` on opencode,
`~/.claude/skills/gstack/` on Claude Code). Invoke them by name (e.g., `/office-hours`).

### Plan-mode reviews

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/office-hours` | Start here. Reframes your product idea before you write code. |
| `/plan-ceo-review` | CEO-level review: find the 10-star product in the request. |
| `/plan-eng-review` | Lock architecture, data flow, edge cases, and tests. |
| `/plan-design-review` | Rate each design dimension 0-10, explain what a 10 looks like. |
| `/plan-devex-review` | DX-mode review: TTHW, magical moments, friction points, persona traces. |
| `/plan-tune` | Self-tune AskUserQuestion sensitivity per question. |
| `/autoplan` | One command runs CEO → design → eng → DX review. |
| `/design-consultation` | Build a complete design system from scratch. |

### Implementation + review

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/review` | Pre-landing PR review. Finds bugs that pass CI but break in prod. |
| `/codex` | Second opinion via OpenAI Codex. Review, challenge, or consult modes. |
| `/investigate` | Systematic root-cause debugging. No fixes without investigation. |
| `/design-review` | Live-site visual audit + fix loop with atomic commits. |
| `/design-shotgun` | Generate multiple AI design variants, comparison board, iterate. |
| `/design-html` | Generate production-quality Pretext-native HTML/CSS. |
| `/devex-review` | Live developer experience audit (TTHW measured against the real flow). |
| `/qa` | Open a real browser, find bugs, fix them, re-verify. |
| `/qa-only` | Same methodology as /qa but report only — no code changes. |
| `/scrape` | Pull data from a web page. First call prototypes; codified call runs in ~200ms. |
| `/skillify` | Codify the most recent successful `/scrape` flow into a permanent browser-skill. |

### Release + deploy

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/ship` | Run tests, review, push, open PR. Workspace-aware version queue. |
| `/land-and-deploy` | Merge the PR, wait for CI and deploy, verify production health. |
| `/canary` | Post-deploy monitoring loop using the browse daemon. |
| `/landing-report` | Read-only dashboard for the workspace-aware ship queue. |
| `/document-release` | Update all docs to match what you just shipped. |
| `/document-generate` | Generate Diataxis docs (tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation) from code. |
| `/setup-deploy` | One-time deploy config detection (Fly.io, Render, Vercel, etc.). |
| `/gstack-upgrade` | Update gstack to the latest version. |

### Operational + memory

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/context-save` | Save working context (git state, decisions, remaining work). |
| `/context-restore` | Resume from a saved context, even across Conductor workspaces. |
| `/learn` | Manage what gstack learned across sessions. |
| `/retro` | Weekly retro with per-person breakdowns and shipping streaks. |
| `/health` | Code quality dashboard (type checker, linter, tests, dead code). |
| `/benchmark` | Performance regression detection (page load, Core Web Vitals). |
| `/benchmark-models` | Cross-model benchmark for skills (Claude, GPT, Gemini side-by-side). |
| `/cso` | OWASP Top 10 + STRIDE security audit. |
| `/setup-gbrain` | Set up gbrain for cross-machine session memory sync. |
| `/sync-gbrain` | Keep gbrain current with this repo's code; refresh agent search guidance in CLAUDE.md. |

### Plugin (opencode only)

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `gstack-plugin-opencode` | Opencode plugin — safety hooks (careful/freeze), team enforcement, auto-update. Install via `opencode.json`: `"plugin": ["./gstack-plugin-opencode"]` |

### Browser + agent integration

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/browse` | Headless browser — real Chromium, real clicks, ~100ms/command. |
| `/open-gstack-browser` | Launch the visible GStack Browser with sidebar + stealth. |
| `/setup-browser-cookies` | Import cookies from your real browser for authenticated testing. |
| `/pair-agent` | Pair a remote AI agent (OpenClaw, Codex, etc.) with your browser. |

### Safety + scoping

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/careful` | Warn before destructive commands (rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push). |
| `/freeze` | Lock edits to one directory. Hard block, not just a warning. |
| `/guard` | Activate both careful + freeze at once. |
| `/unfreeze` | Remove directory edit restrictions. |
| `/make-pdf` | Turn any markdown file into a publication-quality PDF. |

## Build commands

```bash
bun install              # install dependencies
bun test                 # run free tests (no API spend)
bun run test:windows     # curated Windows-safe subset (runs on windows-latest)
bun run build            # generate docs + compile binaries
bun run gen:skill-docs   # regenerate SKILL.md files from templates
bun run skill:check      # health dashboard for all skills
```

## Platform support

- **macOS** + **Linux**: full test suite supported.
- **Windows**: curated Windows-safe subset runs on `windows-latest` via the
  `windows-free-tests` CI job. Setup script (`./setup`) requires Git Bash or
  MSYS today; native PowerShell support is a future expansion. The `bin/gstack-paths`
  helper resolves state roots through `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` / `GSTACK_HOME` so plugin
  installs work on every platform.

## Key conventions

- SKILL.md files are **generated** from `.tmpl` templates. Edit the template, not the output.
- Run `bun run gen:skill-docs --host codex` to regenerate Codex-specific output.
- The browse binary provides headless browser access. Use `$B <command>` in skills.
- Safety skills (careful, freeze, guard) use inline advisory prose — always confirm before destructive operations.
- State paths resolve via `bin/gstack-paths` (sourced via `eval "$(...)"`). Honors `GSTACK_HOME`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, `CLAUDE_PLANS_DIR`.
- The `claude` CLI binary resolves via `browse/src/claude-bin.ts` (`Bun.which()` + `GSTACK_CLAUDE_BIN` override). Set `GSTACK_CLAUDE_BIN=wsl` plus `GSTACK_CLAUDE_BIN_ARGS='["claude"]'` to run Claude through WSL on Windows.

## gbrain integration

gbrain v0.34.4.0 is installed and configured with PGLite. It provides:

- **Semantic search**: `gbrain search <query>` — keyword search over all indexed code/docs
- **Cross-session memory**: `gbrain put <slug>` / `gbrain get <slug>` — persist and retrieve knowledge
- **Hybrid query**: `gbrain query <question>` — RRF search with embeddings (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
- **Code awareness**: `gbrain reindex-code` / `gbrain sync --strategy code` for code files
- **Symbol lookup**: `gbrain code-def <symbol>`, `gbrain code-refs <symbol>`, `gbrain code-callers <symbol>`

The gstack repo (125 pages, 3214 chunks) is imported and embedded via a
worktree-pinned code source (`.gbrain-source` at repo root — auto-routes
all `gbrain` CLI calls from this worktree). Use `gbrain search` instead of
Grep for semantic questions. Run `/sync-gbrain` to refresh. OpenAI API key
is stored in `~/.gbrain/config.json`.

gbrain binary is at `~/.bun/bin/gbrain` — add `~/.bun/bin` to PATH if not already set.

### Session start — mandatory

**At the start of EVERY session** (before answering the user's first question), search gbrain for relevant context:

1. Search for the current project: `gbrain search "<basename of git root>" --limit 10`
2. Search for recent session context: `gbrain search "session context checkpoint" --limit 10`
3. Search for the user's identity/profile: `gbrain search "user profile kiffer" --limit 5`
4. Read the most relevant page(s) found to understand past work, decisions, and state.

This runs every session to provide continuity. If gbrain returns nothing, proceed without context.

## Skill routing (synced from CLAUDE.md)

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore

## Deploy Configuration (synced from CLAUDE.md)

- Platform: GitHub-only — no server deploy
- Production URL: none (CLI tool, installed via git/setup)
- Deploy workflow: `.github/workflows/evals.yml` (CI)
- Deploy status command: GitHub Actions — check CI status on PR
- Merge method: squash
- Project type: CLI
- Post-deploy health check: none — CI passing is the gate

## Preamble note — opencode host detection

gstack's skill preambles now detect opencode alongside Claude Code for gbrain
MCP configuration. The fallback chain is:
1. `~/.claude.json` (Claude Code MCP config)
2. Project-level `opencode.json` 
3. Global `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`

This was added in the opencode migration patch; all SKILL.md files have been
regenerated to include this fallback.
